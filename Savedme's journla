today I leaern 2 error in Android 

first is ANR (Application Not Responding)
ANR is an error that occurs when the main thread does not receive a return value-
from a certain method during the operation and there is no response for a certain period of time.

Second is FATAD 
This is a fatal error that occurs when the application is not compatible with a platform
such as Windows, Android OS, etc. because of incompatibility between applications.
This error may prevent the application from being used normally unless it finds and fixes the logic
that conflicts with the platform.

I use Google translation program. (but little :))
It's interesting experience to me.
